    <h1>Network time synchronized JavaScript clock / widget<br/>
        by Kwynn Buess  <span class='hdate'>2020, January</span></h1>
    
    <p><a href='https://kwynn.com/t/9/12/sync/'>Currently running on kwynn.com</a></p>

    <p>
This is a client-side JavaScript web application that displays a clock that should be accurate to roughly 20ms.
Essentially I'm competing with or offering an alternative to <a href='https://time.gov/widget/widget.html'>NIST widget</a> 
<span style='padding-left: 1ex; padding-right: 1ex'>or</span> 
<a href='https://www.time.gov/'>NIST main time page</a>. See "Motivation / History" below.
    </p>

    <h3>OVERVIEW ON HOW IT WORKS</h3>

    <p>
The hard part is on the client (JavaScript) side, but there is some PHP involved.  The widget AJAX-calls the server first for "chrony" info (see 
below) and then it polls the server a number of times for the time.  If all goes well, the user gets an accurate time and optionally a bunch of 
info on how accurate the time is.</p>

    <h3>BROWSER COMPATIBILITY ISSUES</h3>

    <p>
I thought such things were so 2008 (got much better a little after that), but welcome back to the 2020 edition of browser compatibility issues.  
When I started the second version (see history below), encapsulation was an issue, so I read up on JavaScript classes.  I read the Mozilla 
Developer Network (MDN) documentation of classes.  In the past I've only had issues with Firefox being somewhat ahead of the standard.  
this time it's behind.  </p>

    <p>
Earlier versions included private class fields / variables.  Those are really not well supported, and removing those was pretty much a matter of search 
and replace '#' to '', so I did that.  Beyond that, I utterly refuse to go backwards in the standard, so I am sticking with public class fields / 
variables.  You can see the somewhat grim compatibility matrix at <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes'>MDN on 
classes</a>. Read it and weep.   </p>

    <p>   My search was not exhaustive, but it doesn't even seem that private variables are in Firefox's pipeline.  Read it and gnash teeth.</p>
    <p>
I tried to make sure the system would still show *a* clock if not synchronized, in the event of zero public field support.  That's why I have 
a "SafeInvoke" JS file.  </p>

<h3>
    SIMPLE.HTML or simple.html</h3>

    <p>
        The index has the "complex" version with all the readouts.  The simple version is the minimal invocation.</p>

    <h3>EXECUTION NARRATIVE / OVERVIEW</h3>
  
    <p>Execution begins in (what I call at the moment) the "Safe Invoke" JS file. In the event of a compatible browser, that code invokes the 
        "on tick" object (currently) at the top of the ...Synced.js file.  That object uses a display object, a "do tick" object, a network 
        / sync object, and an internal error / correction object. The internal and external (network) objects use a statistics object for average 
        and standard deviation.
</p>

<code>Function(testClassString)();</code>

<p>This is an alternative to eval() that lets me test for public field support.  See 
    <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#Never_use_eval!'>MDN on "never use eval"</a>.

<p>
    If public fields aren't supported, the "Function" throws an exception.  If they are, we can safely load the JS file that contains public fields.</p>
<p>
Note the JS file "onload" and the window "onload." You have to wait for both.  With one the classes don't exist yet; with the other the HTML clock 
element id(s) don't exist yet.</p>
<p>
    If there is an exception we fall back to functions that tick a local (client-side) clock with no sync.  </p>


<h3>CHRONY</h3>
<p>
    Chrony is a Network Time Protocol implementation / system.  In Ubuntu Linux, it's installed with:</p>
<code>
    $ sudo apt install chrony</code>
<p>[... for reference: ] chrony is already the newest version (3.2-4ubuntu4.2). [as of "Thu Jan 16 22:29:04 EST 2020"]</p>

<p>
    Note that in Ubuntu you may have to / better disable the default Ubuntu timekeeping service:</p>
<code>
    $ sudo systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd</code>
<p>Otherwise timesyncd was "killing" chrony at reboot.</p>

<p>timesyncd does not claim to be as accurate as NTP, but I may have decided it was good enough except for:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href='https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/keeping-time-with-amazon-time-sync-service/'>Amazon Web Services (AWS) recommends chrony</a> 
        as a way to take advantage of their time service.
    </li>
    <li>It gives very simple-to-access and thorough feedback on its own health with <br/>
        <code>$ chronyc tracking    [no root / sudo necessary, even www-data can access it just fine]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>See sample output further below.</p>

<p>
I need to experiment again, but, as I remember, timesyncd was accurate to around 10ms and chrony is usually accurate to within a few microseconds 
on AWS.  </p>

<h3>IS AWS? / "isAWS"</h3>

<p>
My raw chrony info includes tests for whether the server is on AWS (more below).  If it is, and chrony is syncing to "169.254.169.123," 
that explains the very accurate time numbers.   A server such as Kwynn.com is getting time signals from a very close source in terms of both physical 
and network distance. The AWS time server is almost certainly in the same building. Network distance is usually on the order of 0.1 - 0.2ms.  Also, 
the AWS region "us-east-1" is in northern Virginia, which is very close to the NIST time server in Gaithersburg, Maryland, US.  I would have thought 
that AWS has their own atomic receivers or clocks, but apparently not, as I describe just below.</p>

<p>
The AWS time server is stratum 3, where 1 is a computer with an atomic clock attached.  However, given the above, the very accurate times 
that chrony reports are believable.  When chrony displays stratum 4, I am almost certain that's "my" stratum, not the one above me.
</p>

<p>
I say the "raw chrony info" because you'd have to see it over the network or as a variable (currently "self.chronyi = JSON.parse(xhr.response);").  
Displaying that info is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<h4>Is AWS? by crypto signature</h4>

<p>I got carried away and went so far as to do the cryptographic test of whether I'm on AWS. More details below.
    
</p>

<h3>MOTIVATION / HISTORY</h3>

<p>From memory, this started in mid-November, 2019.  At some point I'll track down the first attempts.</p>

<p>
If the time.gov / NIST widget worked easily, I might have been happy with it.  I don't remember how long I spent trying to get it to work--less 
than an hour, I think, and more than half an hour.  I got the very basics to work, but I didn't get all the features.  Also, the code was 
minimized.  I didn't look too hard for dev / "maximized" code; maybe it's out there.  Given that it was minimized, it was harder to trace 
with Chrome Developer Tools (or the equivalent).</p>

<p>
So I decided to try for myself.  Also, I wanted more readouts / info than the NIST apps offer.  Then it became a challenge when I did just about 
everything wrong that I could, several times over.  I found that keeping track of signs (+ or -) and keeping track of the basics of what I was 
doing was a challenge--more so than many other projects.  So then it became a matter of "if it's the last thing I do."  At one point I swept the 
slate clean and started over.  The new version used JavaScript classes, and that second version is still similar to what I have now.</p>

<h3>TO DO</h3>

<p>Finish documentation, such as for the display object.  I'm sure there is plenty more, but it's time to release something.
    
</p>

<h3>NOTES TO SELF / "INTERNAL" TO DO</h3>

<p>Remember to fully harmonize sntp chrony and this: hard links both dev and AWS.  ?getOffsetOnly.  Perhaps move from chrony to getChrony.
